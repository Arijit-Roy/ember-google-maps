  This component yields a hash of contextual components that includes components
  defined in ember-google-maps addons.

  Each component receives three attributes:
    * map – the current map instance.

    * _internalAPI – a set of private methods to register/unregister the
      component with the parent g-map component.

    * gMap – the yielded map context, which includes all the contextual
      components defined here. This allows addon authors to use "prestrung" map
      components using the same contextual API as app developers.
