 * Empty component to watch the contents of overlays for changes. Pass in an

 *
 * The overlay component is rerendered when the marker is repositioned on zoom.
 * As a result, it's not possible to tell what causes the rerender â€“ changes in
 * the template or setting the new position. This separate component wrapper
 * lets us decouple the content block's rendering logic from the marker.
